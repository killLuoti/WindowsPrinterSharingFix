## Code Conventions

- **UI Language**: Bilingual support (Indonesian and English with user toggle `[L]`). User-facing prompts are localized with persistent registry selection.
- **Code Language**: English (Function names, variables, and structural logic).
- **Logging**: use the native `Write-Log` function for all critical operational logging.
- **Error Handling**: Always wrap registry mutations and service state changes within `try/catch` blocks to prevent fatal crashes.
- **Comments**: Maintain clean, descriptive comments for complex logic blocks.
